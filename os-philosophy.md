Core Philosophy: Predicting Mutual Value Creation

Traditional recruiting matches keywords to requirements. We predict mutual value creation by asking:

Can they do it? (Skills/experience match)
Will they do it well? (Trajectory/momentum match)
Will they want to do it? (Motivational/stage fit)
Will they stay? (comp/location fit)
Will company want them? (Level/pace/style match)

The key insight: Matching isn't about "does this resume contain these keywords?" It's about "will this person thrive in solving this problem at this company?"

The Two-Way Matching Problem
Forward Matching: Job → Candidates

Recruiter has a problem to solve: "Need backend engineer with payments experience"
System finds people who can solve that problem
Challenge: Natural language queries need to be enhanced and structured

Reverse Matching: Candidate → Jobs

New candidate enters the system
System proactively finds opportunities they'd be good for
Challenge: Don't spam, show diverse meaningful opportunities

Both directions must use symmetrical embeddings - candidates and jobs described in the same semantic space.
