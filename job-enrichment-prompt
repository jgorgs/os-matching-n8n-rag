2. Context (company stage, team, business impact)
3. Success profile (what "good" actually looks like)
4. Alternative backgrounds (non-obvious fits)

## ANALYSIS GUIDELINES

### Experience Level Inference
- Look for explicit seniority signals: "15+ years", "lead teams of 5+", "VP-level"
- Manager indicators: "manage team", "build team", "lead PMs"
- IC indicators: "hands-on", "individual contributor", "senior engineer"
- Executive indicators: "strategic vision", "board-level", "C-suite", "P&L ownership"

### Company Stage Clues
- Startup: "founding", "early stage", "seed funded", "0 to 1", "<50 employees"
- Growth: "Series B-D", "scaling", "100-500 employees", "$10M-$100M revenue"
- Late Stage: "Series E+", "pre-IPO", "500+ employees", "$100M+ revenue"
- Public: "publicly traded", "Fortune 500", "established leader"

### Work Mode Analysis
- BUILDER_OPERATOR: "hands-on", "ship code", "build from scratch", "0 to 1"
- STRATEGIC_LEADER: "vision", "strategy", "roadmap", "executive stakeholders"
- PEOPLE_MANAGER: "build team", "mentor", "hire", "develop talent"
- PLAYER_COACH: "hands-on contributor who also leads", "IC with leadership"

### Success Profile Extraction
Look for:
- Explicit outcomes mentioned: "drive $X revenue", "reduce churn by Y%"
- Timeline indicators: "first 90 days", "year one", "within 6 months"
- Critical path items: "must establish", "need to build", "responsible for"

### Alternative Backgrounds
Think about:
- What adjacent roles could do this? (Consultant → Operator, IC → Manager)
- What transferable domains? (Finance payments → SaaS payments, Retail ops → Tech ops)
- What non-obvious combinations? (Engineer + MBA for technical PM role)

### Red Flags to Note
- Unrealistic combinations: "5 years experience" + "executive leadership"
- Kitchen sink requirements: 20+ must-have skills
- Vague outcomes: "make things better" without specifics

## EXAMPLES

Example 1 - Senior PM Role:
Job: "Senior Product Manager for our payments platform. 5+ years PM experience. Built payment products at scale. Work with engineering, design, data."

Analysis:
{
  "experience_level": "Senior IC",
  "sub_function": "product",
  "work_style": "builder_operator",
  "company_background_fit": ["fintech", "payments companies", "B2B SaaS with payments"],
  "must_have_done_before": ["Shipped payment products", "Worked with transaction processing"]
}

Example 2 - VP Leadership Role:
Job: "VP of Sales to build enterprise sales team from 0 to 20 reps. 10+ years sales experience, 5+ years managing managers. $50M+ quota carried."

Analysis:
{
  "experience_level": "VP",
  "leadership_requirements": {
    "must_have_managed": true,
    "leadership_style_needed": "strategic",
    "team_building_required": true
  },
  "trajectory_fit": "CLIMBING",
  "must_have_done_before": ["Built sales team from scratch", "Managed managers", "Enterprise B2B sales"]
}

Example 3 - Technical IC Role:
Job: "Staff Engineer for infrastructure. 10+ years backend. Built distributed systems at scale. Mentor junior engineers but not a manager role."

Analysis:
{
  "experience_level": "Senior IC",
  "work_style": "builder_operator",
  "leadership_requirements": {
    "must_have_managed": false,
    "leadership_style_needed": "hands_on",
    "team_building_required": false
  }
}

## IMPORTANT RULES
1. Extract both explicit and implicit requirements
2. Identify must-haves vs. nice-to-haves carefully
3. Company names: extract clean name without descriptions
4. Salary: extract both min and max if range given
5. Be specific about success criteria - avoid vague terms
6. Identify non-obvious alternative backgrounds
7. Note any red flags or unrealistic combinations
8. Mark fields as null if truly unclear (don't guess wildly)

Now analyze the provided job posting and return the enriched JSON profile.
