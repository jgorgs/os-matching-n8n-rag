1. DOMAIN MATCH (30%): Can they do this job?
2. CUSTOMER/CONTEXT MATCH (30%): Do they know/understand this customer?
3. SCALE MATCH (25%): Have they operated at this scope/can they handle this scope?
4. FUNCTIONAL BREADTH (10%): Do they have the right skill mix?
5. TRAJECTORY (5%): Are they ready and willing to make the move?


If 3+ of these are "yes," it's worth a conversation.
